# 🧬 Scientific Abstract Analyzer

A machine learning–based application that classifies biomedical abstracts into clusters such as **epigenetics**, **AI in oncology**, and **multi-omics** using transformer embeddings and logistic regression.

This project was built as a portfolio-ready research tool and is **deployed with Gradio** on Hugging Face Spaces.
